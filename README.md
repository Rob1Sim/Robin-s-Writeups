# Robin's Writreups  

Welcome to my collection of boot-to-root and CTF writeups. Each folder contains a detailed REPORT.md describing my process, tools used, and lessons learned from hacking and privilege escalation challenges.

## 🧩 Purpose

This repository serves as both:  
	-	A personal learning log to track my progress in penetration testing.  
	-	A technical portfolio showcasing my methodology and problem-solving skills.  

All reports are written in Markdown for readability and version control.
